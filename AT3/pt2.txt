PC-PT HR2 (Fa0/1 on Access2)
PC-PT Sales2 (Fa0/2 on Access2)
Server-PT HR Server (Fa0/1 on Access3)
Server-PT Sales Server (Fa0/2 on Access3)
Access Router (Fa0/3 on Access3)

Configuration Steps

1. VLAN Configuration on Switches

Dist1, Dist2, Access1, Access2, Access3
enable
configure terminal
vlan 10
name HR
vlan 20
name Sales
vlan 90
name Management
exit

2. Access Port Configuration

!Access1(g0/1, g0/2, f0/1, f0/2)
interface range f0/1,f0/2
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10  (for fa0/1)
switchport access vlan 20  (for fa0/2)
exit
Access2
interface range f0/1, f0/2
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10  (for fa0/1)
switchport access vlan 20  (for fa0/2)
exit
Access3
interface range fa0/1
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10
exit
interface fa0/2
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 20
exit

3. Trunk Port Configuration

Distrib1
interface range fa0/1-f2/1
switchport mode trunk
exit
Distrib2
interface range fa1/1-f3/1
switchport mode trunk
exit
Access1
interface g0/1
switchport mode trunk
exit
Access2
interface g0/1
switchport mode trunk
exit
Access3
interface g0/1
switchport mode trunk
interface fa0/3
switchport mode trunk
exit

4. Management VLAN Interface Configuration

Access1
interface range fa0/1-2
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 20  !(for fa0/1 - Sales1)
switchport access vlan 10  !(for fa0/2 - HR1)
exit

Access2:
interface range fa0/1-2
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10  (for fa0/1 - HR2)
switchport access vlan 20  (for fa0/2 - Sales2)
exit

Access3:
interface fa0/1
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10  (for HR Server)
exit
interface fa0/2
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 20  (for Sales Server)
exit

Trunk Port Configuration (Step 6 & 7)

Distrib1:
interface range f0/1 - f2/1
switchport mode trunk
exit

Distrib2:
interface range f0/1 - f2/1
switchport mode trunk
exit

! Management plan interface ip address config
Access1
interface vlan 90
ip address 172.16.90.10 255.255.0.0 (Change IP for each switch)
no shutdown
exit
5. Default Gateway Configuration

ip default-gateway 172.16.128.1


6. Copy Running Configuration to Startup Configuration

Dist1, Dist2, Access1, Access2, Access3
copy running-config startup-config


Verification Commands

Show VLANs:
show vlan brief
This will display the VLANs configured on the switch, their names, and the ports assigned to them.

Show Interface Status:
show interfaces status
This will show the status of each interface, including its VLAN assignment and mode (access or trunk).

Show Trunk Interfaces:
show interfaces trunk
This will display the trunk interfaces and their allowed VLANs.

Ping Test:
From a PC in VLAN 10, ping another PC in VLAN 10. From a PC in VLAN 20, ping another PC in VLAN 20.

ping <IP address of the target PC>
Example: Access Router Configuration

You'll need to configure the Access Router's Fa0/3 interface for trunking and assign an IP address to the Vlan90 subinterface.

enable
configure terminal
interface fa0/3
no shutdown
encapsulation dot1q 90
ip address 172.16.90.1 255.255.0.0
no shutdown
exit
